        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data (attributes) and code (methods) to manipulate that data.  It emphasizes modularity, reusability, and data encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects.  It defines the attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** An object is an instance of a class.  It is a concrete entity that has specific values for the attributes defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Abstraction** involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem, hiding unnecessary details from the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encapsulation** is the mechanism of hiding the internal state (attributes) of an object and restricting access to it through methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Dunder methods (also called magic methods or special methods) are methods in Python that have double underscores __ at the beginning and end of their names. They are used to define how objects of a class behave in certain situations (e.g., __init__ for initialization, __str__ for string representation).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (derived or child class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (base or parent class).  It promotes code reuse and the creation of hierarchies of classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in their own specific ways.  It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Encapsulation is achieved in Python by using naming conventions (e.g., using a single underscore _ or a double underscore __ prefix for attributes) to indicate that attributes are intended to be private.  Python doesn't enforce strict private access like some other languages, but these conventions signal to developers that these attributes should not be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** A constructor is a special method called __init__ in Python.  It is automatically called when an object of a class is created.  It is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** A class method is a method bound to the class and not the instance of the class. It takes the class itself as the first argument (cls).  It is defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "A static method is a method bound to the class and not the instance of the class. It doesn't take self or cls as the first argument.  It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within a class.  Python doesn't support traditional method overloading like some other languages. However, you can achieve similar behavior using default arguments, variable-length arguments, or conditional logic within a single method.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a different implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.  It allows the subclass to customize the behavior of inherited methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.\tWhat is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:**\tThe @property decorator in Python is used to define getter methods for class attributes. It allows you to access instance attributes like regular attributes but with the ability to execute code (like getting or setting values) behind the scenes.   \n",
        "\n",
        "14.\tWhy is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Polymorphism is important because it allows for flexibility and extensibility in OOP. It enables you to write code that can work with objects of different classes in a unified way, promoting code reuse and reducing complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.\tWhat is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for other classes. It may contain abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be implemented by its subclasses. In Python, you create abstract classes using the @abc module.   \n",
        "\n",
        "16.\tWhat are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:**\n",
        "OOP offers several advantages, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "  . Modularity: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable objects.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Reusability: Inheritance allows reusing code from existing classes.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Encapsulation: Protecting data and controlling access to it.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  . Polymorphism: Writing flexible code that can work with different types of objects.   \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "17.\tWhat is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:**\n",
        "\n",
        "o A class variable is a variable that is shared by all instances (objects) of a class. It is defined within the class but outside any instance method.   \n",
        "\n",
        "o\tAn instance variable is a variable that is unique to each instance of a class. It is defined within the instance methods (e.g., __init__) using self variable_name.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.\tWhat is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "**Ans:** Multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit from more than one base class. Python supports multiple inheritance, allowing a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes.   \n",
        "\n",
        "19.\tExplain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "**Ans:**\n",
        "\n",
        "o The __str__ method is used to provide a human-readable string representation of an object. It is called by the str() function and the print() statement.   \n",
        "\n",
        "o\tThe __repr__ method is used to provide an unambiguous string representation of an object. It is called by the repr() function and is often used for debugging and development. If __str__ is not defined, Python falls back to using __repr__.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.\tWhat is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** The super() function is used to call methods from a parent class in a subclass. It is particularly useful in inheritance to access overridden methods or to call the parent class's constructor (__init__).   \n",
        "\n",
        "21.\tWhat is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:**\n",
        "o\tThe __del__ method is a destructor method in Python. It is called when an object is garbage collected (i.e., when it's no longer being used and the memory is reclaimed).\n",
        "o\tIt's used to perform cleanup actions (e.g., closing files, releasing resources) before an object is destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.\tWhat is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:**\n",
        "@staticmethod: A static method is bound to the class but does not have access to the instance (self) or the class itself (cls). It's essentially a regular function that belongs to the class's namespace.   \n",
        "\n",
        "o\t@classmethod: A class method is bound to the class and receives the class (cls) as the first argument. It can access and modify class-level attributes.   \n",
        "\n",
        "23.\tHow does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Polymorphism in Python, in the context of inheritance, is primarily achieved through method overriding. When a subclass overrides a method of its superclass, objects of the subclass can be used where objects of the superclass are expected. When the method is called, the correct version (from the subclass) will be executed. This allows different subclasses to provide their own implementations of a method while still adhering to a common interface.   \n",
        "\n",
        "24.\tWhat is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** Method chaining is a technique where multiple method calls are chained together in a single statement. This is achieved by having each method return the object itself (self). This allows you to call a sequence of methods on the same object in a concise way.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.\tWhat is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ans:** The __call__ method allows an object of a class to be called as if it were a function. When you \"call\" an object (e.g., obj()), the __call__ method is executed. This is useful for creating objects that have function-like behavior.\n",
